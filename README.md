# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a responsive user interface that facilitates seamless interaction with an existing API for blog management. This project is part of Noroff's first year Frontend development full-time online course (FED1). 

# Description
This project is a front-end web application designed to showcase a dynamic blogging platform. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it serves as a practical demonstration of the skills acquired throughout the FED1 program. The application allows users to view and interact with blog posts while providing management capabilities for the blog owner.

### Key features include:
- Interactive Carousel: Users can view the three latest posts in an animated carousel, enabling easy navigation to individual posts.
- Latest Posts Feed: A responsive grid displays the twelve most recent posts, allowing users to quickly select and read articles.
- Blog Post Page: Each post features a responsive layout showcasing the title, author, publication date, image, and content, with shareable URLs for easy distribution.
- Admin Management: Owners have dedicated pages for logging in, registering, editing, and deleting blog posts, ensuring secure and efficient management of content.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of this application, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Planning and designing a web application project.
- Building a user interface using HTML and CSS without the use of frameworks.
- Implementing JavaScript to interact with API data and enhance UI functionality.
- Testing the application to ensure reliability and compliance with web standards.
- Deploying the application to a static hosting platform.

### Client and Target Audience
The fictional client for this project, HotView Labs, operates in the tech research and development sector, providing accurate insights to tech leaders worldwide. The application caters to both public users seeking informative blog content and owners who manage the blog.

# Project Technologies
- HTML: Used for structuring the content of the web application.
- CSS: Employed for styling and ensuring the application is responsive.
- JavaScript: Utilized for implementing interactivity and handling API requests.
- APIs: Integrated with Noroff's API to manage blog posts, including functionalities for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting posts.
- GitHub: Used for version control and collaboration on the project.
- Static Hosting Platform: Deployed on GitHub Pages for public access.

### Project Repository
GitHub Repository: The project is hosted on GitHub, with a dedicated repository that includes version control. The repository is linked to GitHub Projects for effective project management and tracking progress. Code and project were initially in a repository created by Noroff. During the project period we were instructed to create our own repository to enable public view. This resulted in loss of commit history for 80% of the project. 

### Development Tools
- Figma: Used for wireframing and designing the user interface.
- Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor.
- Online Testing Tools: For validating HTML and WCAG compliance. https://validator.w3.org/ and https://wave.webaim.org/
